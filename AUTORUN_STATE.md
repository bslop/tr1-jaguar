# jag_openlara — autorun state

RUN: 84

**This file is how work survives a context ending.** A context can end without
warning; anything the next run needs must be here, not in the conversation.
`tools/session_run.sh end` **refuses to advance the counter** if this file was
not touched, because a run that learned something and did not write it down has
lost it.

Every run: `tools/session_run.sh start` → work → `tools/session_run.sh end "<summary>"`.
Every 25 runs the script prints a PROGRESS REPORT DUE banner — the user reviews
direction at that point and decides whether it is still valid. **Do not
summarise that checkpoint away.**

## NEXT STEP

# ✅ `tools/checkshot.py` - THE FRAME IS NOW ASSERTED, NOT EYEBALLED.

Reading frames by eye has produced FOUR phantom defects here, and writing down
"measure, don't eyeball" three times did not stop the fourth. So it is a script
now (jag_viewpoint's point: discipline does not scale, a script does).

    tools/checkshot.py shot.png [--size 320x80] [--baseline mrt] [--min-colours N]
    tools/checkshot.py --selftest

Each check exists because of a specific failure it would have caught:
    SIZE            a dead ctl session returns a **64x1** frame whose stats are
                    meaningless but computable - I read one as a total fix (run 53)
    DISTINCT LUMAS  NOEMPTYY=1 and NOSDCULL=1 build, report **illegal=0**, and
                    render NOTHING (flat luma-76 field). A scene has ~65 lumas; a
                    flat field has 1 (runs 53/54)
    RIGHT COLUMN    RCLIPFIX - column w-1 black in EVERY scene for months because
                    a right-exclusive span end was clamped to an INCLUSIVE clip
                    value. Compared against column w-2, not a constant, so a dark
                    scene cannot trip it
    ALL WHITE       under HOLEVIS a mostly-white frame means NOTHING was covered
    BASELINE        black% vs the recorded per-level number, because open-sky rooms
                    are legitimately 38% black (run 69) - never a constant

☠️ **`--selftest` PROVES EVERY CHECK CAN FAIL** (5/5: flat field, wrong size, dark
right column, all white, and a healthy scene passing). A checker nobody has seen
fail may be asserting nothing - the same class of mistake as jag_viewpoint's
round-trip OLP check that was self-consistent across a wrong premise.
★ It earned its keep immediately by catching MY OWN wrong expectation twice: I
asserted 320x240 for a conformance frame (it is 320x80) and for the release
in-game frame (it is 320x120).

### ☠️ FRAME SIZE DEPENDS ON THE SCENE, NOT THE ROM
    conformance / smoke in-game   320x80    (VRESN=80)
    release in-game               320x120   (LOWRES)
    title ring, FMV               320x240   (plain 240)
Pass the right `--size` or the checker stops at the size line and tells you every
later number is junk - which is correct, but only useful if you know why.

### ★ WIRED IN: `toolchain_smoke.sh` now ASSERTS
It used to screenshot and print black%/maxluma for a human to compare. Both
render-nothing builds above would have sailed through that. It now fails the smoke
test on any checkshot failure.
⬜ Worth wiring next, same one-liner each: `build_conf.sh` (after its render
check), and `release_play.py` (assert each captured frame instead of printing
stats).

### ⬜ NEXT
  1. Wire checkshot into `build_conf.sh` and `release_play.py`.
  2. The 8 unproven doors from run 77 - **fix the DRIVE first**: after a switch or
     a wall-square, Lara's facing is reset (run 82), so restore or measure the yaw
     before asserting anything about a doorway.
  3. A test-card ROM (`HW_TESTCARD`) for the black-TV fork.
  4. Climb OUT of the pool (swimming in works, run 78).

### ⏳ STILL AWAITING THE USER: WHAT DOES THE TV SHOW?
`/tmp/cofout7/OPENLARA.COF` on the real Jaguar since run 75 (`OK!`). Capture is
dead upstream of the card, so the ladder collapses to the TV.

### ☠️ CLOSED - DO NOT REOPEN
    mansion holes (50-59) · pickups (65) · mid-walk LOADING (67) ·
    caves black wedges (69, OPEN SKY) · caves room crossing (72, FIXED) ·
    gym room 18 (73/78, the POOL - swimming WORKS) ·
    7 "dead doors" (74, balconies) ·
    caves 11->12 and the switch/door (79-82: ALL of it works; the block was the
    post-switch facing, and run 80's "defect" was retracted)

### ✅ WHAT IS DONE
    climbing   CAVES 24/24 ledges, 6/6 walls · MANSION 24/24, 6/6
    walking    CAVES 50/58 doors · MANSION 9/18
    swimming   the mansion POOL: enter, swim, room 18, renders correctly
    switches   fire, animate, release, open the door, and she walks through
    enemies    BEAR and WOLVES render on shipping flags
    pickups    MEDIKIT_SMALL collected on contact, verified against a control
    frames     ASSERTED by tools/checkshot.py, with a passing selftest
    release    /tmp/cofout7 - on the real Jaguar since run 75, verdict pending

### Toolchain — STILL PINNED to 59e5896 (`COBWEB_DIR=/tmp/cobweb-old`)
`beb2c15` does NOT fix the jcc68k regression (16-bit param read moved +2,
breaking gcc/jcc mixed links). `tools/toolchain_smoke.sh` guards updates.
ROMs: `/tmp/conf.cof` (Caves), `/tmp/gym.cof` (mansion, AUTOGYM, **no PADMUTE**).

### Instruments (all offline, no rig)
    conformance.py    driven per-spot sweep; best-height verdict, per-level
                      black baseline, jump drive for JUMPGRAB
    room_black.py     per-room black% baseline (caves 51.2 max, gym 36.3)
    floor_coverage.py collision-vs-mesh scan + patch (--prefix, --faces)
    mrt_boundary_audit.py  seam-floor audit + patch (--prefix)
    toolchain_smoke.sh     build a ROM and LOOK at it after a toolchain move

### ⬜ AWAITING THE USER (run-25 checkpoint)
  1. Capture card replugged? 2. Ship Lara's Home? 3. Release or keep polishing?
Nothing pushed to `origin` (public `tr1-jaguar`).

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUNS 9-11 (2026-08-16)

- ✅✅ **Release recipe proven end to end** with all four videos, both guards, and
  a real SD-card boot in jagemu.
- ✅ **Title-music refill fixed** to read the DRAM mailbox and stamp stale —
  correct per the codebase's own law, but **offline-unverifiable**; needs silicon.
- ✅ **Filed a real emulator divergence** to jaguar-shared: jagemu lets the 68k
  read a running core's local SRAM honestly, so this whole bug class is invisible
  offline. Asked for a counter, not a behaviour change, because other projects
  read those ranges today.
- ✅ **`session_run.sh end` guards against mid-build commits** — hit for real with
  three of four videos converted.
- ★ Lesson worth keeping: *a fix that produces no measurable change is not
  automatically wrong* — but it is also not confirmed. Say which one it is.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 8 (2026-08-16)

- ✅✅ **Mansion verified through the real menu path** and the release now ships
  it selectable (`GYMSD` dropped from `build_cof.sh`).
- ✅ **`AUTOGYM=1` added** — the first offline test that covers the shipping
  menu-exit path rather than the GYMTEST shortcut.
- ☠️ **Caught a hook-precedence trap**: AUTOSTART preempted AUTOGYM even though
  `-DAUTOGYM` was on the compile line. Made the precedence explicit in source so
  no caller can hit it by flag ordering.
- ★ The measurements that made shipping it possible, in one place: gym_lskin
  alias −107,040 B; TEXSCALE=4 + RAMP_PAL + no STATICS = 254,296 B payload;
  6 of 6 pads at 1,554,268 B.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 7 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Mansion now fits: 6 of 6 pads, ROM 1,554,268 B**, by dropping STATICS
  from its extraction (−107,368 B). Boots clean, vector intact.
- ☠️ **Corrected a wrong claim I made twice** — runs 5 and 6 both reported the
  mansion linking, from a bare `make` that skips the stack-headroom guard.
  Under `gbuild.sh` it built **nothing**.
- ✅ **`tools/build_cof.sh`** now carries the exact working combination and the
  measurements behind it, plus `$MRTENV_NOSTATICS`.
- ★ Found that under **GYMSD the menu refuses Lara's Home on purpose** — so
  shipping it playable means building without GYMSD.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 6 (2026-08-16)

- ✅✅ **The mansion looks right** — re-extracted with the full recipe including
  `RAMP_PAL` (whose "extractor dies" note was stale), atlas 90,112 → 134,144 B.
  Went from nearly black to a properly lit interior.
- ✅ **Proved no caves regression** — pixel-identical render, all pads boot.
- ✅ **`tools/build_cof.sh` updated** so the release build reproduces it.
- ☠️ **Recorded a clean negative**: the A10-boot-lottery link is unproven, and
  the offline test cannot decide it. Better than leaving the hypothesis dangling.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 5 (2026-08-16)

- ✅✅ **Lara's Home is fixed** — no crash, vector intact, Lara renders. The bug
  that made it "broken" is closed.
- ✅ **`gpu_kernel_ensure()`** added and called from all six kicks; jvdec load
  invalidates residency, jvdec done restores it.
- ✅ **All kicks now set `params[1]`** (mailbox pointer), closing a second,
  independent instance of the same overlap hazard.
- ✅ **Published `techniques/gpu-kernel-residency.md`** to jaguar-shared — the
  general lesson (a kick launches whatever is resident; overlapping param slots
  turn a stale kernel into vector-table corruption) plus the diagnostic that cut
  through it: dump GPU SRAM and byte-compare against every built kernel.
- ★ Method note: the bug wore three disguises — "renderer bug" (the stripes were
  the crash beacon), "GPU wedge" (exc_catch halts Tom itself), and "corrupt
  pointer" (it was a constant, +2). Runs 2-4 each chased one.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 4 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Root cause found and proven**: 68k vector 64 overwritten with
  `MAGIC_DONE` by the GPU's completion store through a bad `r30`. Caves vector
  verified intact as the control.
- ✅ **Fixed a real latent bug in 5 kick functions** — `params[1]` (the kernel's
  mailbox pointer) was never restored after `gpu_jvdec_kick` reused it as
  `prevLen`. Verified corrected at the world kick.
- ✅ **Localised the remaining cause** to `r30` being clobbered inside the
  kernel (holds the atlas pointer at halt), between f166 and f172.
- ⬜ Raised the possibility that this **is** the A10 boot lottery ("VI never
  fires") — a concrete, cheap test is written above.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 3 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Disproved run 2's root cause** with a frame-by-frame timeline. The 68k
  faults first; the halted GPU is `exc_catch`'s own doing. Recorded above so the
  next run does not re-derive it.
- ✅ **Localised the real fault** to an `rts` returning to `MAGIC_DONE`, i.e. a
  stack imbalance of exactly 8 bytes, and cleared `cpu_stop_unless` of blame by
  reading it.
- ✅ **New technique: probe labels.** Label every instruction in a block,
  re-assemble, `cmp` to prove byte-identical, and read the exact PC→instruction
  mapping off the map. Left as `gpu_probe.gas`.
- ★ Named the wedge candidate precisely (`movei #DISPCUR,r1`, one after
  `load (r0),r2`) before the timeline showed it was a red herring — worth
  keeping as the shape of "precise but wrong".

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 2 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Root-caused the mansion failure to a GPU wedge** in the kernel's room-list
  init, with the crash frame, the GPU PC, and the watchdog path all identified.
  Reframes the bug completely: it is not textures, UVs or the atlas.
- ✅ **Published `techniques/reading-a-crash-without-a-capture-card.md`** to
  jaguar-shared (c70e277) — how to read a crash with `jagemu peek` when the
  capture card is gone, the "your garbage may be your own crash beacon" warning,
  the `PADTEXT` symbolisation trap, and the sentinel-vs-corruption lesson.
- ✅ **cobweb ad713ec → b8dd333** (4 commits incl. GOURD intensity and the
  blitter BUSY settle window). Renderer re-assembled **byte-identical**;
  `COBWEB_REV` bumped in the Dockerfile.
- ★ Learned: the archived gym assets predate the current extractor and their
  `gym_lskin` differs — the `build_cof.sh` alias guard added in run 1 is what
  makes that safe.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 1 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Enemies fully skinned — 553/553 faces** (bat and bear were 0/41 and
  0/261). ★ Check the SPLIT not the total: 34 of the bat's 41 faces are
  coloured, so texturing alone helped it least. **Not yet seen on silicon.**
- ✅ **−107,040 B from every ROM** — `gym_lskin` was a duplicate of Lara's
  skeleton *and* sat outside the `GYMSD` `#endif`. Now a `.set` alias.
- ✅ **Lara's Home LINKS again** (1,524,188 B) via that alias + `TEXSCALE=4`.
- ✅ **`GYMTEST`/`CAVETEST` plumbed** — they never had been, so a GYMTEST arm
  silently rendered the Caves.
- ✅ **Two rig-protocol violations fixed** (`climb_matrix.sh`, `vroll_game.sh`).

---

## STANDING RULES FOR EVERY RUN

- ☠️ **Check cobweb first** — `tools/cobweb_check.sh`. Its updates change what
  is POSSIBLE here, not just what is buggy.
- ☠️ **Read `jaguar-shared`** — five sessions write hardware facts into it.
  `session_run.sh start` does both of the above.
- ☠️ **Push to `wip` (private), never `origin`.** `origin` is
  `bslop/tr1-jaguar` and it is **PUBLIC** — pushing there IS the release, which
  the user gated on his own sign-off and wants coordinated with a video.
- ☠️ **`rm -rf build` before any A/B**, and **verify the flag reached the
  compile line** — not just that it exists. A build arm producing byte-identical
  output to another arm is not "working", it is **unwired**.
- ☠️ **`make FOO=0` turns FOO ON.** Omit the flag instead.
- ☠️ Never `git add -A` in `jaguar-shared` — it is one working tree shared by
  every session, and another project's half-finished edit is usually sitting in
  it.

## HARDWARE — READ BEFORE PLANNING ANY RIG STEP

- **The capture card is PHYSICALLY UNPLUGGED** (jag_quake, 2026-08-16): no
  `/dev/video*`, no `0fd9:` on any bus. And there is **no other channel to read
  a number off the board** — no jaggd memory-read, no GD BIOS FWRITE, bulk IN
  times out, CDC has no Jaguar-side write path. **Rig time currently produces a
  picture on a TV that a human must read.** This devalues the `WORLDCOUNT`
  framebuffer diagnostic for task #11 — plan around it.
- **Roster is five** (openlara, quake, bubsy3d, rr, resident). A session not on
  it is **queued, not refused**. `jaguar-shared/hw/RESOURCES.md` is the
  agreement; `hw/GD_ACCESS.md` is openlara's gateway.
- **openlara has the slot after `jag_bubsy3d`**, batched — items #2, #8, #10,
  #11 plus visual confirmation of the enemy skins and the mansion are ONE
  console session, not six.
- Claim the rig **only** for work the emulator genuinely cannot answer.
