# jag_openlara — autorun state

RUN: 114

**This file is how work survives a context ending.** A context can end without
warning; anything the next run needs must be here, not in the conversation.
`tools/session_run.sh end` **refuses to advance the counter** if this file was
not touched, because a run that learned something and did not write it down has
lost it.

Every run: `tools/session_run.sh start` → work → `tools/session_run.sh end "<summary>"`.
Every 25 runs the script prints a PROGRESS REPORT DUE banner — the user reviews
direction at that point and decides whether it is still valid. **Do not
summarise that checkpoint away.**

### What may interrupt the 25 — and what may not (user, 2026-08-17)

> **The full working agreement lives in `/home/jvilla/Documents/Git/jaguar-shared/DEVELOPMENT.md`** — read it
> before your first run. This is the project-local copy of the loop rule.

Run the 25 autonomously. Exactly **two** things break the loop early, and only
one of them ends it:

1. **A question for the user.** Direction, an irreversible change, a fact only
   they can supply. Stop, ask, wait.
2. **Needing the real Jaguar — this does NOT stop the loop.** Queue it and
   carry on:

   ```sh
   jagq run <rom> --frames 3   # queue → flash → capture → hand back
   jagq status                 # who holds it, who is waiting
   ```

   `jagq run` blocks until your turn arrives, so *waiting for the rig is part of
   the run*, not a reason to end it. Exit 0 = ran; 3 = job failed
   (`jagq log <id>`); 4 = broker down (`jagq up`).

⭐ **The arbiter is now `jagq`, not `jaghw`** (user's call, 2026-08-17).
`jag_gd.sh` keeps working unchanged — `hw/jaghw` forwards to `jagq`, and `jagq`
exports `JAGHW_HELD` as well as `JAGQ_HELD` so its re-entrant nesting still
composes. Two things that were this project's problem are now the broker's:

- **The turn cap is enforced centrally** — 300 s for every lease, session token
  and hold, whatever the caller asks for.
- **The capture card is inside the exclusion.** `climb_matrix.sh:110`'s five
  acquisitions with the settle and the `grab` *unlocked* — the shape that
  photographs another project's frame — cannot happen through `jagq run`, which
  flashes and captures inside one turn. Worth re-reading that loop against
  `jagq run --capture`.

See the migration section at the top of `jaguar-shared/hw/PROTOCOL.md`.

## NEXT STEP

# ✅✅ BOTH QUALITY ARMS PASS THE GATE. THE PICTURE/SPEED CHOICE IS NOW FREE.

`tools/release_check.py` gives **7/7 on both** shipping payloads, so whichever
the user picks is already verified end to end:

    QUALITY=playable  /tmp/cofout8   320x**80**   67 colours   z moved **17,484**
    QUALITY=pretty    /tmp/cofout9   320x**120**  76 colours   z moved **14,476**

Same ROM recipe, same 300 fields of held UP, same seat. ★ The gate measured the
frame-rate cost INDEPENDENTLY without meaning to: distance is per-FRAME, so
covering 14,476 units where the other covers 17,484 means the 120-line build
rendered **~17% fewer frames** - arriving at run 106's +14.7% from the opposite
direction, by a completely different mechanism. Two independent measurements
agreeing is worth more than either alone.

### ☠️ REMEMBER WHICH ONE SHIPS - I GOT IT BACKWARDS ONCE
`tools/build_cof.sh:75`: `QUALITY=playable` **is** `VRESN=80`, and
`PLAY_BUILD.md`'s recipe passes `playable`. **80 lines is the status quo and the
+14.7% is already banked.** The open choice is whether to PAY ~15% to go
`pretty` at 120 lines for the sharper picture (76 colours vs 67, visibly finer
vertical detail). `/tmp/quality_ab.png` shows both, correctly labelled this time,
each scaled to the 240-line window the TV fills - sent to the user.

### ⬜ NEXT
  1. **The user's call on `pretty` vs `playable`** - both verified, no risk
     either way. This is the whole of the run-100 checkpoint's "frame rate"
     option, now with pictures and two independent measurements.
  2. **The rig rules still contradict the autorun prompt** (run 111): his docs
     say the capture card is back and `jagq` QUEUES rather than refuses; the
     prompt says unplugged and leave it batched. Untouched pending his word.
     `/tmp/TESTCARD.COF` is staged for the first console session.
  3. No known gameplay defect. Run `release_check.py` before any push.

### ⚠️ BUILD STATE
`/tmp/cofout8/` = the SHIPPING payload with ALL THREE gameplay fixes (COF +
ELF + .JV + MUSIC.PCM + GYMLOAD.DAT). `/tmp/gym.cof` = MVDIAG build with the
entry fix. `/tmp/conf.cof` = caves, boot-checked.
☠️ `tools/build_conf.sh` takes **caves|gym|both** - not `mrt`.
☠️ `release_play.py` now WIPES its output dir first: OUT is a fixed path and a
drive that dies while booting leaves the PREVIOUS run's complete frame set
sitting there. I read 54 stale PNGs as this run's output; only the mtimes gave
it away. ☠️ `find -newermt "12:29"` is INVALID here (bfs wants ISO 8601) and
prints an error to stderr while the pipeline reports 0 - a check that never ran.

### ⬜ ALSO OPEN
  1. Capture the hardware boot **if the user grants permission** -
     upload -> observe -> `jag_gd.sh endturn` inside ONE 5-minute turn.
  2. The 8 untestable door seats; `HW_TESTCARD`.

### ☠️ CLOSED - DO NOT REOPEN
    mansion holes (50-59) · pickups (65) · mid-walk LOADING (67) ·
    caves black wedges (69) · caves room crossing (72) · swimming IN (78) ·
    7 "dead doors" (74) · caves 11->12 + switch/door (79-82) ·
    all mansion door failures (85) · all Caves door failures (86-88) ·
    **mansion pool climb-out (93)**

### ✅ WHAT IS DONE
    climbing   CAVES 24/24 ledges, 6/6 walls · MANSION 24/24, 6/6
    walking    CAVES 51 doors · MANSION 9 · zero defects either level
    swimming   enter/swim/room 18/renders · climb-out HALF FIXED (see above)
    switches   fire, animate, open the door, and she walks through
    enemies    BEAR and WOLVES render on shipping flags
    pickups    MEDIKIT_SMALL collected on contact, verified against a control
    frames     asserted by checkshot at BUILD time and at every driven capture
    rig        leases capped at 5 min; `jag_gd.sh endturn` reboots at turn end
    release    /tmp/cofout7 - verified in the EMULATOR; hardware verdict pending

### Toolchain — STILL PINNED to 59e5896 (`COBWEB_DIR=/tmp/cobweb-old`)
`beb2c15` does NOT fix the jcc68k regression (16-bit param read moved +2,
breaking gcc/jcc mixed links). `tools/toolchain_smoke.sh` guards updates.
ROMs: `/tmp/conf.cof` (Caves), `/tmp/gym.cof` (mansion, AUTOGYM, **no PADMUTE**).

### Instruments (all offline, no rig)
    conformance.py    driven per-spot sweep; best-height verdict, per-level
                      black baseline, jump drive for JUMPGRAB
    room_black.py     per-room black% baseline (caves 51.2 max, gym 36.3)
    floor_coverage.py collision-vs-mesh scan + patch (--prefix, --faces)
    mrt_boundary_audit.py  seam-floor audit + patch (--prefix)
    toolchain_smoke.sh     build a ROM and LOOK at it after a toolchain move

### ⬜ AWAITING THE USER (run-25 checkpoint)
  1. Capture card replugged? 2. Ship Lara's Home? 3. Release or keep polishing?
Nothing pushed to `origin` (public `tr1-jaguar`).

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUNS 9-11 (2026-08-16)

- ✅✅ **Release recipe proven end to end** with all four videos, both guards, and
  a real SD-card boot in jagemu.
- ✅ **Title-music refill fixed** to read the DRAM mailbox and stamp stale —
  correct per the codebase's own law, but **offline-unverifiable**; needs silicon.
- ✅ **Filed a real emulator divergence** to jaguar-shared: jagemu lets the 68k
  read a running core's local SRAM honestly, so this whole bug class is invisible
  offline. Asked for a counter, not a behaviour change, because other projects
  read those ranges today.
- ✅ **`session_run.sh end` guards against mid-build commits** — hit for real with
  three of four videos converted.
- ★ Lesson worth keeping: *a fix that produces no measurable change is not
  automatically wrong* — but it is also not confirmed. Say which one it is.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 8 (2026-08-16)

- ✅✅ **Mansion verified through the real menu path** and the release now ships
  it selectable (`GYMSD` dropped from `build_cof.sh`).
- ✅ **`AUTOGYM=1` added** — the first offline test that covers the shipping
  menu-exit path rather than the GYMTEST shortcut.
- ☠️ **Caught a hook-precedence trap**: AUTOSTART preempted AUTOGYM even though
  `-DAUTOGYM` was on the compile line. Made the precedence explicit in source so
  no caller can hit it by flag ordering.
- ★ The measurements that made shipping it possible, in one place: gym_lskin
  alias −107,040 B; TEXSCALE=4 + RAMP_PAL + no STATICS = 254,296 B payload;
  6 of 6 pads at 1,554,268 B.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 7 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Mansion now fits: 6 of 6 pads, ROM 1,554,268 B**, by dropping STATICS
  from its extraction (−107,368 B). Boots clean, vector intact.
- ☠️ **Corrected a wrong claim I made twice** — runs 5 and 6 both reported the
  mansion linking, from a bare `make` that skips the stack-headroom guard.
  Under `gbuild.sh` it built **nothing**.
- ✅ **`tools/build_cof.sh`** now carries the exact working combination and the
  measurements behind it, plus `$MRTENV_NOSTATICS`.
- ★ Found that under **GYMSD the menu refuses Lara's Home on purpose** — so
  shipping it playable means building without GYMSD.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 6 (2026-08-16)

- ✅✅ **The mansion looks right** — re-extracted with the full recipe including
  `RAMP_PAL` (whose "extractor dies" note was stale), atlas 90,112 → 134,144 B.
  Went from nearly black to a properly lit interior.
- ✅ **Proved no caves regression** — pixel-identical render, all pads boot.
- ✅ **`tools/build_cof.sh` updated** so the release build reproduces it.
- ☠️ **Recorded a clean negative**: the A10-boot-lottery link is unproven, and
  the offline test cannot decide it. Better than leaving the hypothesis dangling.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 5 (2026-08-16)

- ✅✅ **Lara's Home is fixed** — no crash, vector intact, Lara renders. The bug
  that made it "broken" is closed.
- ✅ **`gpu_kernel_ensure()`** added and called from all six kicks; jvdec load
  invalidates residency, jvdec done restores it.
- ✅ **All kicks now set `params[1]`** (mailbox pointer), closing a second,
  independent instance of the same overlap hazard.
- ✅ **Published `techniques/gpu-kernel-residency.md`** to jaguar-shared — the
  general lesson (a kick launches whatever is resident; overlapping param slots
  turn a stale kernel into vector-table corruption) plus the diagnostic that cut
  through it: dump GPU SRAM and byte-compare against every built kernel.
- ★ Method note: the bug wore three disguises — "renderer bug" (the stripes were
  the crash beacon), "GPU wedge" (exc_catch halts Tom itself), and "corrupt
  pointer" (it was a constant, +2). Runs 2-4 each chased one.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 4 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Root cause found and proven**: 68k vector 64 overwritten with
  `MAGIC_DONE` by the GPU's completion store through a bad `r30`. Caves vector
  verified intact as the control.
- ✅ **Fixed a real latent bug in 5 kick functions** — `params[1]` (the kernel's
  mailbox pointer) was never restored after `gpu_jvdec_kick` reused it as
  `prevLen`. Verified corrected at the world kick.
- ✅ **Localised the remaining cause** to `r30` being clobbered inside the
  kernel (holds the atlas pointer at halt), between f166 and f172.
- ⬜ Raised the possibility that this **is** the A10 boot lottery ("VI never
  fires") — a concrete, cheap test is written above.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 3 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Disproved run 2's root cause** with a frame-by-frame timeline. The 68k
  faults first; the halted GPU is `exc_catch`'s own doing. Recorded above so the
  next run does not re-derive it.
- ✅ **Localised the real fault** to an `rts` returning to `MAGIC_DONE`, i.e. a
  stack imbalance of exactly 8 bytes, and cleared `cpu_stop_unless` of blame by
  reading it.
- ✅ **New technique: probe labels.** Label every instruction in a block,
  re-assemble, `cmp` to prove byte-identical, and read the exact PC→instruction
  mapping off the map. Left as `gpu_probe.gas`.
- ★ Named the wedge candidate precisely (`movei #DISPCUR,r1`, one after
  `load (r0),r2`) before the timeline showed it was a red herring — worth
  keeping as the shape of "precise but wrong".

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 2 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Root-caused the mansion failure to a GPU wedge** in the kernel's room-list
  init, with the crash frame, the GPU PC, and the watchdog path all identified.
  Reframes the bug completely: it is not textures, UVs or the atlas.
- ✅ **Published `techniques/reading-a-crash-without-a-capture-card.md`** to
  jaguar-shared (c70e277) — how to read a crash with `jagemu peek` when the
  capture card is gone, the "your garbage may be your own crash beacon" warning,
  the `PADTEXT` symbolisation trap, and the sentinel-vs-corruption lesson.
- ✅ **cobweb ad713ec → b8dd333** (4 commits incl. GOURD intensity and the
  blitter BUSY settle window). Renderer re-assembled **byte-identical**;
  `COBWEB_REV` bumped in the Dockerfile.
- ★ Learned: the archived gym assets predate the current extractor and their
  `gym_lskin` differs — the `build_cof.sh` alias guard added in run 1 is what
  makes that safe.

---

## WHAT CHANGED IN RUN 1 (2026-08-16)

- ✅ **Enemies fully skinned — 553/553 faces** (bat and bear were 0/41 and
  0/261). ★ Check the SPLIT not the total: 34 of the bat's 41 faces are
  coloured, so texturing alone helped it least. **Not yet seen on silicon.**
- ✅ **−107,040 B from every ROM** — `gym_lskin` was a duplicate of Lara's
  skeleton *and* sat outside the `GYMSD` `#endif`. Now a `.set` alias.
- ✅ **Lara's Home LINKS again** (1,524,188 B) via that alias + `TEXSCALE=4`.
- ✅ **`GYMTEST`/`CAVETEST` plumbed** — they never had been, so a GYMTEST arm
  silently rendered the Caves.
- ✅ **Two rig-protocol violations fixed** (`climb_matrix.sh`, `vroll_game.sh`).

---

## STANDING RULES FOR EVERY RUN

- ☠️ **Check cobweb first** — `tools/cobweb_check.sh`. Its updates change what
  is POSSIBLE here, not just what is buggy.
- ☠️ **Read `jaguar-shared`** — five sessions write hardware facts into it.
  `session_run.sh start` does both of the above.
- ☠️ **Push to `wip` (private), never `origin`.** `origin` is
  `bslop/tr1-jaguar` and it is **PUBLIC** — pushing there IS the release, which
  the user gated on his own sign-off and wants coordinated with a video.
- ☠️ **`rm -rf build` before any A/B**, and **verify the flag reached the
  compile line** — not just that it exists. A build arm producing byte-identical
  output to another arm is not "working", it is **unwired**.
- ☠️ **`make FOO=0` turns FOO ON.** Omit the flag instead.
- ☠️ Never `git add -A` in `jaguar-shared` — it is one working tree shared by
  every session, and another project's half-finished edit is usually sitting in
  it.

## HARDWARE — READ BEFORE PLANNING ANY RIG STEP

- ✅✅ **THE CAPTURE CARD IS BACK** (verified 2026-08-17) — this answers run-25
  checkpoint question #1. `/dev/video0` and `/dev/video1` both enumerate, and a
  grab through the broker returned the **GameDrive menu listing our own
  `OPENLARA.COF`, `CAVSLOAD.BIN`, `GYMLOAD.BIN`, `INPUT.BIN`** off the SD card —
  183 KB PNG, where a no-signal frame is ~1 KB. **The `WORLDCOUNT` framebuffer
  diagnostic is viable again**, and rig time no longer produces a picture only a
  human can read. The 2026-08-16 "physically unplugged" finding is superseded.
  ⭐ What survives from it: there is still **no channel to read a number
  *directly* off the board** — no jaggd memory-read, no GD BIOS FWRITE, bulk IN
  times out, CDC has no Jaguar-side write path. Telemetry still has to be
  painted into the framebuffer and read off a capture; the difference is that
  the capture now works.
- **The rig is shared, and arbitrated by `jagq`.** A session not on the roster
  is **queued, not refused**. `jaguar-shared/hw/RESOURCES.md` is the agreement,
  `hw/GD_ACCESS.md` is this project's gateway, and
  `/home/jvilla/Documents/Git/jaguar-shared/DEVELOPMENT.md` is the working
  agreement over both.
- **Batch what needs the console.** Items #2, #8, #10, #11 plus visual
  confirmation of the enemy skins and the mansion are ONE console session, not
  six — now bounded by the 5-minute turn, so batch only what fits in a turn.
- Claim the rig **only** for work the emulator genuinely cannot answer.
